# Animated Rocket Loading Indicator React Component

Originally, I have developed this component as part of my KSC Space Launches hobby project. Later I decided to replace it with more classically looking circle spinner component. 

The animated rocket is coded with pure CSS.

To achieve the effect of animated message dots, we make some (or all) period symbols transaprent. This allows us to maintain the constant length of the loader message and prevents its shifting during the animation. Of course, this can be done in a number of other ways - possibly simpler, but this is what came to my head first, and I figured it's a decent way of doing it.
